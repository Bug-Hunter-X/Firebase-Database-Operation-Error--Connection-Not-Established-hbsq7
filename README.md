# Firebase Database Operation Error: Connection Not Established

This repository demonstrates a common error in Firebase applications where database operations are attempted before the Firebase connection is fully established. This often results in errors due to a race condition between initialization and data access.

## Problem

The asynchronous nature of Firebase initialization can cause issues if database operations are performed immediately after initializing the app.  This code may fail due to the database reference being accessed prematurely.

## Solution

The provided solution uses Firebase's `onAuthStateChanged` listener to ensure the app is initialized before accessing the database. This listener triggers a callback function after Firebase authentication is complete, ensuring that the database connection is ready.
