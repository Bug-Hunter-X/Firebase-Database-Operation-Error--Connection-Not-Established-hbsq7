The solution involves ensuring that database operations only happen after Firebase has finished initializing.  The `onAuthStateChanged` listener provides a reliable way to achieve this.  This listener waits for the authentication state to change and then performs the database operation, guaranteeing that the database connection is established.

```javascript
// Correct way using onAuthStateChanged
firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
firebase.auth().onAuthStateChanged((user) => {
  if (user) {
    // User is signed in.
    console.log('User is signed in:', user);
    firebase.database().ref('/users').set({
      uid: user.uid,
      name: user.displayName
    }).then(() => {
      console.log('Data written successfully!');
    }).catch((error) => {
      console.error('Error writing data:', error);
    });
  } else {
    // No user is signed in.
    console.log('No user is signed in.');
  }
});
```
This improved code uses promises to handle potential errors during the database write operation, making it more robust.
