The Firebase SDK might throw an error if you try to access a database reference before the connection is established. This can occur if you try to perform database operations immediately after initializing the Firebase app. The asynchronous nature of Firebase's initialization can lead to this race condition. For example, if you write data to the database in your app's main function before the Firebase app has completely initialized, it might throw an error.  Here's an example of the wrong way to do it:

```javascript
// Incorrect way
firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
firebase.database().ref('/users').set({
  uid: 'someUID',
  name: 'someName'
});
```
This code might fail. The correct way to handle this is to wait for the Firebase app to initialize completely. You can use the `onAuthStateChanged` listener to ensure the app is ready:
```javascript
firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
firebase.auth().onAuthStateChanged((user) => {
  if (user) {
    // User is signed in.
    console.log('User is signed in:', user);
     firebase.database().ref('/users').set({
      uid: user.uid,
      name: user.displayName
    });
  } else {
    // No user is signed in.
    console.log('No user is signed in.');
  }
});
```
